## Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to leverage the Pony programming language and the actor model to create an efficient solution to this problem on multi-core systems. The problem requires identifying sequences of consecutive integers such that their sum of squares is a perfect square.

### Input:
- The program takes two integers, N and k, as command-line arguments.

- `N`: The upper bound on the range of numbers.
- `k`: The length of the sequence of consecutive numbers.
- `Goal`: Find all sequences of k consecutive integers (starting from 1 or higher, and up to N) such that the sum of their squares equals a perfect square.

### Output
- For each sequence that satisfies the condition, the program will print the first number in the sequence.
